# 📱 Flutter Training Projects

During my training with EasyLearn Academy, I built 3 different Flutter screens to strengthen my mobile development skills:

## 🧾 1. Business Card App
A digital business card with profile picture and contact buttons (Phone – WhatsApp – Email – Instagram).  
➡ Practiced using **CircleAvatar**, gradients, and reusable widgets.

## ℹ️ 2. Info App (What is Flutter?)
Descriptive screen about Flutter with images, text, and social media icons.  
➡ Practiced **BoxDecoration**, **Gradients**, and layout structuring.

## 📰 3. Flutter News App
News-style layout with featured image, styled title, and short description.  
➡ Practiced **RichText**, **ClipRRect**, and clean layouts.
